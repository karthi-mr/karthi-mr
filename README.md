# Hi 👋, I'm Karthi

## Full-Stack Developer | Java | Spring Boot | React | Angular | PostgreSQL

I’m a **Full-Stack Developer** with hands-on experience in building **end-to-end web applications**, **RESTful APIs**, and **scalable backend systems** using Java and modern web technologies.

I currently work as a **Software Developer (Automation & Backend)** at a startup, where I design and implement **Java- and Python-based automation solutions**, improve framework scalability, and collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver reliable software systems.

Previously, I worked at **Zoho Corporation** as a **QA Engineer**, gaining strong experience in **API testing, UI testing, automation, and system reliability**. This background gives me a quality-first mindset while building production-ready applications.
